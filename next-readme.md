# Routing?
- Routing is like giving direction to a wesite. When you type a web address (URL) into your browser, route tells the website which page or thing to show you. It's like a map that guides the website to the right place when you click a link or enter a web address. So, routing helps the website know what to display based on what you're looking for.
